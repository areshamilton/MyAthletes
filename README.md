Overview
Summary
A fitness app designed for athletes of a team. The coach will be able to access and modify data with respect to the athletes. The purpose of this app is for athletes to know what their workouts will be before coming in to practice for weightlifting. Based on the equipment accessible by the athletes, there will be a rotation so that a single piece of equipment will not be used by multiple athletes, and multiple athletes won’t have to be waiting at a single piece of equipment until whoever is using it is done.

Platforms
Android devices

Background and motivation
The problem we are trying to address is how athletes will often have to go to their coach whenever there is a weightlifting routine, and with so many athletes on a team, it is hard for coaches to tell everyone what to do. Once the coach tells all of their athletes what to do, it may have taken up 5-10 minutes out of the amount of time they’re given. With our app, athletes will know ahead of time, and will be able to start the moment they enter the gym.

Features
Provide a list of your application’s features and which team member is responsible for that feature. You should have at least the same number of features as team members, but you can have more. I will not look for the implementation of other features so you can list them for future reference.

Describe the purpose of each feature to help the reader imagine how this feature will work. If available, provide mock screens and descriptions of related features.

Joseph Luong: We plan to have a log-in feature in which users will be able to log in using Google and Facebook or sign up using their email/phone.

A place to store information, preferably on the local storage of the coach's phone. This will allow the coach to monitor progress easily, and modify any workouts that they see fit per athlete.

Ares Hamilton: Provide a video/description of how to perform a workout. (e.g. An athlete is to do Deadlifts, Pullups, and Bent Over Rows, at any point the athlete will be able to see how to do the workout and watch a video on how to do it)

Jon Dorman: A calculator that calculates the amount of effort performed on a workout, if it is too easy for the athlete, it will suggest a higher weight for the athlete to do the next time.

Eddie Rayo: A countdown timer that will contain a visual progress bar of the remaining time for the current workout. It will feature a tap to pause function as well as a button to count the amount of rest time.
